# Crypto 2048

Crypto 2048 is a modern twist on the classic 2048 game. Instead of numbers, the tiles represent popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and others. Your goal is to combine matching crypto tiles to reach the ultimate tile, "MATIC" (2048).

## Features
- Classic 2048 gameplay with a crypto theme.
- Crypto symbols replace traditional numbers for a fresh experience.
- Minimalistic and intuitive text-based interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Crypto2048.git

2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python crypto_2048.py

## How to Play
